This is a React project that provides functionality for fetching and displaying data with filter options, pagination, and dynamic data loading based on user-selected filters. The project is designed to make it easy for users to navigate through data sets, apply filters, and view filtered data.

# Features

# Initial Loading

Upon the initial load of the application, all available data is fetched and displayed.

# Pagination

The project offers pagination functionality with "Next Page" and "Previous Page" buttons, enabling users to navigate through the dataset easily.

# Filter Options

There are three types of filters available to users:

Filter Type 1: Get Data for Selected Category.

Filter Type 2: Get Data for Selected Channel.

Filter Type 3: Get Data for Selected State.

Filter Type 4: Sort Data by Ascending/Descending Order of Source Time.

# Dynamic Data Loading

After choosing a filter, the application will dynamically load data that matches the selected filter criteria. The selected filter will be prominently displayed to provide clarity to the user.

# Removing Filters

If a user decides to remove a filter, the application will automatically revert to the initial loading state, fetching and displaying the entire dataset.

#npm i to install all npm packages
#npm start to start the app in localhost:3000
